In this program, I created a Java servlets with RESTful APIs to handle HTTP requests and responses. Besides, I built relational databases (MySQL) and implemented CRUD interfaces to save user data. Finally, I developed the interactive web pages utilizing ReactJS and Ant Design and used AJAX to send data to the back end server

Through designing and developed the website by myself, Iâ€™ve felt an incredible sense of satisfaction in being able to utilize my knowledge to assist people in sharing their lives to others.
