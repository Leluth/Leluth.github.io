On May. 2018, we hold the Huazhong University of Science and Technology Hackathon. Thus, I developed this website for teams participating in this competition to register and update their works.

I built this website via Spring and VueJS. For the teams, they got channels to know the latest news and share their outcomes. For myself, by learning and adopting Vue.js, I deepened my understanding of the development of website and visual design.
