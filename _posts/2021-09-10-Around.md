[Around](https://github.com/Leluth/Around) is a web application where users can create video posts and browse nearby posts.

It's a social network developed with ReactJS. And it improved the authentication using token based registration/login/logout flow with React Router 
v4 and server-side user authentication with JWT. Moreover, a scalable web service was launched in Go to handle user posts and deployed to Google Cloud (Google App Engine). Furthermore, it used ElasticSearch (deployed to GCE) to enable users to search recent posts and list personal posts.
