[OnlineOrder](https://github.com/Leluth/OnlineOrder) is a web application implementing Rest API via Spring MVC including registration, menu searching, ordering, checkout, etc.

It utilized Hibernate to access and operate the data storage (menu, restaurants, etc). 
And both authentication and authorization via Spring security are provided to protect the application from malicious attacks.
Moreover, the Spring framework core technologies are implemented to loosely decouple all the components in the application and 
the client-side with ReactJS and Ant Design are built to allow users to add items to the shopping cart and place orders.
