This product was designed to help the blind people resolve problems in their daily lives more effectively. Our team applied computer vision technologies from Tencent and Google, as well as inserting the artificial intelligence recognition function into the product. It is able to realize the recognition of OCR text, colors and certificates, etc.

What's more, considering the instability of AI recognition, I proposed and then constructed a chat room function in this product, where users can look for help from volunteers by sending images and videos. After this update was completed, our numbers of daily active users boomed and the product was openly embraced by members of the blind community.

Throughout the development, I led the programming team and worked on prototyping and the front-end development, having drawed around 20 protographs and written over 5000 lines of code in WXML, WXSS and JavaScript.
